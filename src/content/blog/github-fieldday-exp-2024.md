# LEARN

**GitHub Field Day Nepal**, as the [official website](https://githubfieldday.com/np2024/) says, is an unconference for student leaders of Nepal facilitated by GitHub Education. In case you're unfamiliar with GitHub Education, its a program that will give you your **free domain**, your **IDEs premiums** and most importantly the **GitHub Copilot** while you're a student with the [GitHub Student Developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers).

# APPLY

The application opens once a year in the month of September and the applicant must be a student, pursuing any Bachelors degree in any university from Nepal. The **hidden qualifications** includes your contribution to the tech community around you, the challenges you've overcome to stand where you stand and the mass of the audience you represent with the leadership skills you posses. More than these the **most required** qualification for GitHub Field Day is the desire and the fire in you to solve the issues, you and your community is facing with the guidance from the mentors, the GitHub Campus Experts and the OCs of the Field Day Nepal.

You're required to answer some critical questions about your community so that the OCs can better understand your vision and your capability to represent where you come from. Additionally, a 1 minute long video of you is required, with no fancy editing, to answer some of the queries OCs might have with you and your plans to address the challenges in your community. This might seem like the hardest part but trust me, its all worth it when you see that `Congratulations üëè Fielder, You're Selected for GitHub Field Day Nepal ‚òÇÔ∏è` mail, for giving that extra push to 100 and 1 percent where others gave up.
